## Getting started 
(*Credit to the [Caged Mobs](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/caged-mobs) Curseforge Page*)

First, you need to craft one from two types of mob cages: the normal one, which you need to harvest by hand, or the hopping mob cage, which stores its drops in the inventory below.

Then put inside an item which will help to set up the environment for the entity, so it can feel at home â€¦ kinda, without being imprisoned of course. Some examples of environments would be:

- For farm animals or neutral mobs you need a hay block (or grass block for better yields)

- Monsters like to hang out in caves, use a stone block (or diamond ore for better yields)

- For nether mobs, you need a magma block (or gilded blackstone for better yields)

- End mobs require end stone (or chorus flower for better yields)

- Aquatic mobs require sand (or red sand for better yields) as the environment and a waterlogged cage! (place the cage in already existing pool of water or shift-right-click it with water bucket)

- Cold biome mobs like snow block (or blue ice for better yields)

- Sand (or red sand for better yields) block for desert entities 

- Red Mushroom Block (or mycelium for better yields) for entities from the mushroom island!

After setting the environment you can finally put inside one of the supported entities. Craft one of the DNA Samplers and hit with it the entity you want to sample. Remember, some entities require stronger samplers!

Wait until it grows and collect its drops!

You can also add upgrades to your cages. The cooking upgrade will automatically cook cookable drops for you, Lighting upgrade will collect drops that would normally require the entity to be hit by lightning and then killed (e.g. mob heads) and Arrow Upgrade will kill entities with arrows (e.g. used for killing Creepers to obtain music discs)
